    Calls :func:`warnings.warn', to emit the message 'msg' as a

    The 'stacklevel' keyword is passed through to warnings.warn.  However by
    default this is set to 2, which ensures that the identified code line is in
    the caller, rather than in this routine.
    See :mod:`warnings` module documentation.

    For example::

        >>> from iris._deprecation import warn_deprecated
        >>> def arrgh():
        ...    warn_deprecated('"arrgh" is deprecated since version 3.5.')
        ...    return 1

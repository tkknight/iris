# IEP 1 - Enhanced indexing

## Background

Currently, to select a subset of a Cube based on coordinate values we use something like:
[source,python]
----
cube.extract(iris.Constraint(realization=3,
                             model_level_number=[1, 5],
                             latitude=lambda cell: 40 <= cell <= 60))
----
On the plus side, this works irrespective of the dimension order of the data, but the drawbacks with this form of indexing include:

* It uses a completely different syntax to position-based indexing, e.g. `cube[4, 0:6]`.
* It uses a completely different syntax to pandas and xarray value-based indexing, e.g. `df.loc[4, 0:6]`.
* It is long-winded and requires the use of an additional class.
* It requires the use of lambda functions even when just selecting a range.

Arguably, the situation when subsetting using positional indices but where the dimension order is unknown is even worse - it has no standard syntax _at all_! Instead it requires code akin to:
[source,python]
----
key = [slice(None)] * cube.ndim
key[cube.coord_dims('model_level_number')[0]] = slice(3, 9, 2)
cube[tuple(key)]
----

The only form of indexing that is well supported is indexing by position where the dimension order is known:
[source,python]
----
cube[4, 0:6, 30:]
----

## Proposal

Provide indexing helpers on the Cube to extend explicit support to all permutations of:

* implicit dimension vs. named coordinate,
* and positional vs. coordinate-value based selection.

### Helper syntax options

Commonly, the names of coordinates are also valid Python identifiers.
For names where this is not true, the names can expressed through either the `helper[...]` or `helper(...)` syntax by constructing an explicit dict.
For example: `cube.loc[{'12': 0}]` or `cube.loc(**{'12': 0})`.

#### Extended pandas style

Use a single helper for index by position, and a single helper for index by value. Helper names taken from pandas, but their behaviour is extended by making them callable to support named coordinates.

|===
.2+| 2+h|Index by
h|Position h|Value

h|Implicit dimension

a|[source,python]
----
cube[:, 2]  # No change
cube.iloc[:, 2]
----

a|[source,python]
----
cube.loc[:, 1.5]
----

h|Coordinate name

a|[source,python]
----
cube[dict(height=2)]
cube.iloc[dict(height=2)]
cube.iloc(height=2)
----

a|[source,python]
----
cube.loc[dict(height=1.5)]
cube.loc(height=1.5)
----
|===

#### xarray style

xarray introduces a second set of helpers for accessing named dimensions that provide the callable syntax `(foo=...)`.

|===
.2+| 2+h|Index by
h|Position h|Value

h|Implicit dimension

a|[source,python]
----
cube[:, 2]  # No change
----

a|[source,python]
----
cube.loc[:, 1.5]
----

h|Coordinate name

a|[source,python]
----
 cube[dict(height=2)]
 cube.isel(height=2)
----

a|[source,python]
----
cube.loc[dict(height=1.5)]
cube.sel(height=1.5)
----
|===

### Slices

The semantics of position-based slices will continue to match that of normal Python slices. The start position is included, the end position is excluded.

Value-based slices will be stricly inclusive, with both the start and end values included. This behaviour differs from normal Python slices but is in common with pandas.

Just as for normal Python slices, we do not need to provide the ability to control the include/exclude behaviour for slicing.

### Value-based indexing

#### Equality

Should the behaviour of value-based equality depend on the data type of the coordinate?

* integer: exact match
* float: tolerance match, tolerance determined by bit-width
* string: exact match

#### Scalar/category

If/how to deal with category selection `cube.loc(season='JJA')`? Defer to `groupby()`?

`cube.loc[12]` - must always match a single value or raise KeyError, corresponding dimension will be removed
`cube.loc[[12]]` - may match any number of values?  (incl. zero?), dimension will be retained

### Out of scope

* Deliberately enhancing the performance.
This is a very valuable topic and should be addressed by subsequent efforts.

* Time/date values as strings.
Providing pandas-style string representations for convenient representation of partial date/times should be addressed in a subsequent effort - perhaps in conjunction with an explicit performance test suite.
There is a risk that this topic could bog down when dealing with non-standard calendars and climatological date ranges.

## Work required

* Implementations for each of the new helper objects.
* An update to the documentation to demonstrate best practice. Known impacted areas include:
** The "Subsetting a Cube" chapter of the user guide.

### TODO
* Multi-dimensional coordinates
* Non-orthogonal coordinates
* Bounds
* Boolean array indexing
* Lambdas?
* What to do about constrained loading?
* Relationship to http://scitools.org.uk/iris/docs/v1.9.2/iris/iris/cube.html#iris.cube.Cube.intersection[iris.cube.Cube.intersection]?
* Relationship to interpolation (especially nearest-neighbour)?
** e.g. What to do about values that don't exist?
*** pandas throws a KeyError
*** xarray supports (several) nearest-neighbour schemes via http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/indexing.html#nearest-neighbor-lookups[`data.sel()`]
*** Apparently http://holoviews.org/[holoviews] does nearest-neighbour interpolation.
* multi-dimensional coordinate => unroll?
* var_name only selection? `cube.vloc(t0=12)`
* Orthogonal only? Or also independent? `cube.loc_points(lon=[1, 1, 5], lat=[31, 33, 32])`
  ** This seems quite closely linked to interpolation. Is the interpolation scheme orthogonal to cross-product vs. independent?

    scheme='nearest',

cube.interpolate(
    scheme=Nearest(mode='spherical'),
    locations=Ortho(lon=[5, 10, 15], lat=[40, 50]))

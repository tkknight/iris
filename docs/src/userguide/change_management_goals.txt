To reduce code maintenance problems to an absolute minimum, Iris applies
defined change management procedures to ensure that :

    * you can be confident that your code will still work with a future release

    * you will be aware of future incompatibility problems in advance

    * you can defer making code compatibility changes for some time, until it suits you

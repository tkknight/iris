Contributing to the Documentation
---------------------------------

This guide is for those comfortable with the development process, looking for
the specifics of how to apply that knowledge to Iris. You may instead find it
easier to use the :ref:`contributing.documentation_easy`.

Any change to the Iris project whether it is a bugfix, new feature or
documentation update must use the :ref:`development-workflow`.


Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The documentation uses specific packages that need to be present.  Please see
:ref:`installing_iris` for instructions.


.. _contributing.documentation.building:

Building
~~~~~~~~

This documentation was built using the latest Python version that Iris
supports.  For more information see :ref:`installing_iris`.

The build can be run from the documentation directory ``docs/src``.

The build output for the html is found in the ``_build/html`` sub directory.
When updating the documentation ensure the html build has *no errors* or
*warnings* otherwise it may fail the automated `Iris GitHub Actions`_  build.

Once the build is complete, if it is rerun it will only rebuild the impacted
build artefacts so should take less time.

There is an option to perform a build but skip the
:ref:`contributing.documentation.gallery` creation completely.  This can be
achieved via::

    make html-noplot

Another option is to skip the :ref:`iris` documentation creation.  This can be
useful as it reduces the time to build the documentation, however you may have
some build warnings as there maybe references to the API documentation.
This can be achieved via::

    make html-noapi

You can combine both the above and skip the
:ref:`contributing.documentation.gallery` and :ref:`iris` documentation
completely.  This can be achieved via::

    make html-quick

If you wish to run a full clean build you can run::

    make clean
    make html

This is useful for a final test before committing your changes. Having built
the documentation, you can view them in your default browser via::

    make show

.. note:: In order to preserve a clean build for the html, all **warnings**
          have been promoted to be **errors** to ensure they are addressed.
          This **only** applies when ``make html`` is run.

.. _contributing.documentation.testing:

Testing
~~~~~~~

There are various ways to test aspects of the documentation.

Each :ref:`contributing.documentation.gallery` entry has a corresponding test.
To run all the gallery tests::

    pytest -v docs/gallery_tests/test_gallery_examples.py

To run a test for a single gallery example, use the ``pytest -k`` option for
pattern matching, e.g.::

    pytest -v -k plot_coriolis docs/gallery_tests/test_gallery_examples.py

If a gallery test fails, follow the instructions in :ref:`testing.graphics`.

The ``make`` commands shown below can be run in the ``docs`` or ``docs/src``
directory.

Many documentation pages includes python code itself that can be run to ensure
it is still valid or to demonstrate examples.  To ensure these tests pass
run::

    make doctest

See :data:`iris.cube.Cube.data` for an example of using the `doctest`_
approach.

.. _doctest: http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/ext/doctest.html

The hyperlinks in the documentation can be checked automatically.
If there is a link that is known to work it can be excluded from the checks by
adding it to the ``linkcheck_ignore`` array that is defined in the
`conf.py`_.  The hyperlink check can be run via::

    make linkcheck

If this fails check the output for the text **broken** and then correct
or ignore the url.

.. note:: In addition to the automated `Iris GitHub Actions`_ build of all the
          documentation build options above, the
          https://readthedocs.org/ service is also used.  The configuration
          of this held in a file in the root of the
          `github Iris project <https://github.com/SciTools/iris>`_  named
          ``.readthedocs.yml``.


.. _conf.py: https://github.com/SciTools/iris/blob/main/docs/src/conf.py


.. _contributing.documentation.api:

Generating API Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to auto generate the API documentation based upon the docstrings a
custom set of python scripts are used, these are located in the directory
``docs/src/sphinxext``.  Once the ``make html`` command has been run,
the output of these scripts can be found in
``docs/src/generated/api``.

If there is a particularly troublesome module that breaks the ``make html`` you
can exclude the module from the API documentation.  Add the entry to the
``exclude_modules`` tuple list in the
``docs/src/sphinxext/generate_package_rst.py`` file.


.. _contributing.documentation.gallery:

Gallery
~~~~~~~

The Iris :ref:`gallery_index` uses a sphinx extension named
`sphinx-gallery <https://sphinx-gallery.github.io/stable/>`_
that auto generates reStructuredText (rst) files based upon a gallery source
directory that abides directory and filename convention.

The code for the gallery entries are in ``docs/gallery_code``.
Each sub directory in this directory is a sub section of the gallery.  The
respective ``README.rst`` in each folder is included in the gallery output.

To add an entry to the gallery simple place your python code into the
appropriate sub directory and name it with a prefix of ``plot_``.  If your
gallery entry does not fit into any existing sub directories then create a new
directory and place it in there.  A test for the gallery entry will be
automatically generated (see Testing_ for how to run it).  To add a new
reference image for this test, follow the instructions in
:ref:`testing.graphics`.

The reStructuredText (rst) output of the gallery is located in
``docs/src/generated/gallery``.

For more information on the directory structure and options please see the
`sphinx-gallery getting started
<https://sphinx-gallery.github.io/stable/getting_started.html>`_ documentation.

   :open:

   The highlights for this minor release of Iris include:

   * We have **archived older Iris documentation** - everything before
     ``v3.0.0`` - so older versions will soon no longer appear in search
     engines. If you need this older documentation: please
     see :ref:`iris_support`.
   * We have added a :ref:`glossary` to the Iris documentation.
   * We have completed work to make **Pandas interoperability** handle
     n-dimensional :class:`~iris.cube.Cube`\s.
   * We have **begun refactoring Iris' regridding**, which has already improved
     performance and functionality, with more potential in future!
   * We have made several other significant `🚀 Performance Enhancements`_.

   And finally, get in touch with us on :issue:`GitHub<new/choose>` if you have
   any issues or feature requests for improving Iris. Enjoy!


v3.4.1 (21 Feb 2023)
====================

.. dropdown:: :opticon:`alert` v3.4.1 Patches
   :container: + shadow
   :title: text-primary text-center font-weight-bold
   :body: bg-light
   :animate: fade-in

   The patches in this release of Iris include:

   #. `@trexfeathers`_ and `@pp-mo`_ made Iris' use of the `netCDF4`_ library
      thread-safe. (:pull:`5095`)

   #. `@trexfeathers`_ and `@pp-mo`_ removed the netCDF4 pin mentioned in
      `🔗 Dependencies`_ point 3. (:pull:`5095`)


📢 Announcements
================

#. Welcome to `@ESadek-MO`_, `@TTV-Intrepid`_ and `@hsteptoe`_,  who made their
   first contributions to Iris 🎉

   .. _try_experimental_stratify:

#. Do you enjoy `python-stratify`_? Did you know that Iris includes a
   convenience for using `python-stratify`_ with :class:`~iris.cube.Cube`\s?
   It has been 'experimental' for several years now, without receiving much
   feedback, so it's **use it or lose it** time: please try out
   :mod:`iris.experimental.stratify` and let us know what you think!


✨ Features
===========

#. `@ESadek-MO`_ edited :func:`~iris.io.expand_filespecs` to allow expansion of
   non-existing paths, and added expansion functionality to :func:`~iris.io.save`.
   (:issue:`4772`, :pull:`4913`)

#. `@trexfeathers`_ and `Julian Heming`_ added new mappings between CF
   standard names and UK Met Office LBFC codes. (:pull:`4859`)

#. `@pp-mo`_ changed the metadata of a face/edge-type
   :class:`~iris.experimental.ugrid.mesh.MeshCoord`, to be same as the face/edge
   coordinate in the mesh from which it takes its ``.points``.  Previously, all MeshCoords
   took their metadata from the node coord, but only a node-type MeshCoord now does
   that.  Also, the MeshCoord ``.var_name`` is now that of the underlying coord, whereas
   previously this was always None.  These changes make MeshCoord more like an ordinary
   :class:`~iris.coords.AuxCoord`, which avoids some specific known usage problems.
   (:issue:`4860`, :pull:`5020`)

#. `@Esadek-MO`_ and `@trexfeathers`_ added dim coord
   prioritisation to ``_get_lon_lat_coords()`` in :mod:`iris.analysis.cartography`.
   This allows :func:`iris.analysis.cartography.area_weights` and
   :func:`~iris.analysis.cartography.project` to handle cubes which contain
   both dim and aux coords of the same type e.g. ``longitude`` and ``grid_longitude``.
   (:issue:`3916`, :pull:`5029`).

#. `@stephenworsley`_ added the ability to regrid derived coordinates with the
   :obj:`~iris.analysis.PointInCell` regridding scheme. (:pull:`4807`)

#. `@trexfeathers`_ made NetCDF loading more tolerant by enabling skipping of
   :class:`~iris.coords.DimCoord`\s, :class:`~iris.coords.AuxCoord`\s,
   :class:`~iris.coords.CellMeasure`\s and
   :class:`~iris.coords.AncillaryVariable`\s if they cannot be added to a
   :class:`~iris.cube.Cube` (e.g. due to CF non-compliance). This is done via
   a new error class: :class:`~iris.exceptions.CannotAddError` (subclass of
   :class:`ValueError`). (:pull:`5054`)

#. `@pp-mo`_ implemented == and != comparisons for :class:`~iris.Constraint` s.
   A simple constraint is now == to another one constructed in the same way.
   However, equality is limited for more complex cases :  value-matching functions must
   be the same identical function, and for &-combinations order is significant,
   i.e.  ``(c1 & c2) != (c2 & c1)``.
   (:issue:`3616`, :pull:`3749`).

#. `@hsteptoe`_ and `@trexfeathers`_ improved
   :func:`iris.pandas.as_data_frame`\'s conversion of :class:`~iris.cube.Cube`\s to
   :class:`~pandas.DataFrame`\s. This includes better handling of multiple
   :class:`~iris.cube.Cube` dimensions, auxiliary coordinates and attribute
   information. **Note:** the improvements are opt-in, by setting the
   :obj:`iris.FUTURE.pandas_ndim` flag (see :class:`iris.Future` for more).
   (:issue:`4526`, :pull:`4909`, :pull:`4669`, :pull:`5059`, :pull:`5074`)


🐛 Bugs Fixed
=============

#. `@rcomer`_ and `@pp-mo`_ (reviewer) factored masking into the returned
   sum-of-weights calculation from :obj:`~iris.analysis.SUM`. (:pull:`4905`)

#. `@schlunma`_ fixed a bug which prevented using
   :meth:`iris.cube.Cube.collapsed` on coordinates whose number of bounds
   differs from 0 or 2. This enables the use of this method on mesh
   coordinates. (:issue:`4672`, :pull:`4870`)

#. `@bjlittle`_ and `@lbdreyer`_ (reviewer) fixed the building of the CF
   Standard Names module ``iris.std_names`` for the ``setup.py`` commands
   ``develop`` and ``std_names``. (:issue:`4951`, :pull:`4952`)

#. `@lbdreyer`_ and `@pp-mo`_ (reviewer) fixed the cube print out such that
   scalar ancillary variables are displayed in a dedicated section rather than
   being added to the vector ancillary variables section. Further, ancillary
   variables and cell measures that map to a cube dimension of length 1 are now
   included in the respective vector sections. (:pull:`4945`)

#. `@rcomer`_ removed some old redundant code that prevented determining the
   order of time cells. (:issue:`4697`, :pull:`4729`)

#. `@stephenworsley`_ improved the accuracy of the error messages for
   :meth:`~iris.cube.Cube.coord` when failing to find coordinates in the case where
   a coordinate is given as the argument. Similarly, improved the error messages for
   :meth:`~iris.cube.Cube.cell_measure` and :meth:`~iris.cube.Cube.ancillary_variable`.
   (:issue:`4898`, :pull:`4928`)

#. `@stephenworsley`_ fixed a bug which caused derived coordinates to be realised
   after calling :meth:`iris.cube.Cube.aggregated_by`. (:issue:`3637`, :pull:`4947`)

#. `@rcomer`_ corrected the ``standard_name`` mapping from UM stash code ``m01s30i311``
   to indicate that this is the upward, rather than northward part of the flow.
   (:pull:`5060`)

#. `@bjlittle`_ and `@trexfeathers`_ (reviewer) fixed an issue which prevented
   uncompressed PP fields with additional trailing padded words in the field
   data to be loaded and saved. (:pull:`5058`)

#. `@lbdreyer`_ and `@trexfeathers`_ (reviewer) fixed the handling of data when
   regridding with :class:`~iris.analysis.UnstructuredNearest` or calling
   :func:`~iris.analysis.trajectory.interpolate` such that the data type and mask is
   preserved. (:issue:`4463`, :pull:`5062`)


💣 Incompatible Changes
=======================

#. `@trexfeathers`_ altered testing to accept new Dask copying behaviour from
   `dask/dask#9555`_ - copies of a Dask array created using ``da.from_array()``
   will all ``compute()`` to a shared identical array. So creating a
   :class:`~iris.cube.Cube` using ``Cube(data=da.from_array(...``, then
   using :class:`~iris.cube.Cube` :meth:`~iris.cube.Cube.copy`,
   will produce two :class:`~iris.cube.Cube`\s that both return an identical
   array when requesting :class:`~iris.cube.Cube` :attr:`~iris.cube.Cube.data`.
   We do not expect this to affect typical user workflows but please get in
   touch if you need help. (:pull:`5041`)

#. `@trexfeathers`_ moved ``iris.experimental.animate.animate()`` to
   :func:`iris.plot.animate`, in recognition of its successful use over several
   years since introduction. (:pull:`5056`)


🚀 Performance Enhancements
===========================

#. `@rcomer`_ and `@pp-mo`_ (reviewer) increased aggregation speed for
   :obj:`~iris.analysis.SUM`, :obj:`~iris.analysis.COUNT` and
   :obj:`~iris.analysis.PROPORTION` on real data. (:pull:`4905`)

#. `@bouweandela`_ made :meth:`iris.coords.Coord.cells` faster for time
   coordinates. This also affects :meth:`iris.cube.Cube.extract`,
   :meth:`iris.cube.Cube.subset`, and :meth:`iris.coords.Coord.intersect`.
   (:pull:`4969`)

#. `@bouweandela`_ improved the speed of :meth:`iris.cube.Cube.subset` /
   :meth:`iris.coords.Coord.intersect`.
   (:pull:`4955`)

#. `@stephenworsley`_ improved the speed of the :obj:`~iris.analysis.PointInCell`
   regridding scheme. (:pull:`4807`)


🔥 Deprecations
===============

#. `@hsteptoe`_ and `@trexfeathers`_ (reviewer) deprecated
   :func:`iris.pandas.as_series` in favour of the new
   :func:`iris.pandas.as_data_frame` - see `✨ Features`_ for more details.
   (:pull:`4669`)


🔗 Dependencies
===============

#. `@rcomer`_ introduced the ``dask >=2.26`` minimum pin, so that Iris can benefit
   from Dask's support for `NEP13`_ and `NEP18`_. (:pull:`4905`)

#. `@trexfeathers`_ advanced the Cartopy pin to ``>=0.21``, as Cartopy's
   change to default Transverse Mercator projection affects an Iris test.
   See `SciTools/cartopy@fcb784d`_ and `SciTools/cartopy@8860a81`_ for more
   details.
   (:pull:`4968`)

#. `@trexfeathers`_ introduced the ``netcdf4<1.6.1`` pin to avoid a problem
   with segfaults. (:pull:`4968`, :pull:`5075`, :issue:`5016`)

#. `@trexfeathers`_ updated the Matplotlib colormap registration in
   :mod:`iris.palette` in response to a deprecation warning. Using the new
   Matplotlib API also means a ``matplotlib>=3.5`` pin. (:pull:`4998`)

#. See `💣 Incompatible Changes`_ for notes about `dask/dask#9555`_.


📚 Documentation
================

#. `@ESadek-MO`_, `@TTV-Intrepid`_ and `@trexfeathers`_ added a gallery example for zonal
   means plotted parallel to a cartographic plot. (:pull:`4871`)

#. `@Esadek-MO`_ added a key-terms :ref:`glossary` page into the user guide. (:pull:`4902`)

#. `@pp-mo`_ added a :ref:`code example <ORCA_example>`
   for converting ORCA-gridded data to an unstructured cube. (:pull:`5013`)
#. `@Esadek-MO`_ added links to relevant Gallery examples within the User Guide
   to improve understanding. (:pull:`5009`)

#. `@trexfeathers`_ changed the warning header for the **latest** documentation
   to reference Read the Docs' built-in version switcher, instead of generating
   its own independent links. (:pull:`5055`)

#. `@tkknight`_ updated the links for the Iris documentation to v2.4 and
   earlier to point to the archive of zip files instead. (:pull:`5064`)

#. `@Esadek-MO`_ began adding notes at the bottom of functions to
   to clarify if the function preserves laziness or not. See :issue:`3292` for
   the ongoing checklist. (:pull:`5066`)

💼 Internal
===========

#. `@rcomer`_ removed the obsolete ``setUpClass`` method from Iris testing.
   (:pull:`4927`)

#. `@bjlittle`_ and `@lbdreyer`_ (reviewer) removed support for
   ``python setup.py test``, which is a deprecated approach to executing
   package tests, see `pypa/setuptools#1684`_.  Also performed assorted
   ``setup.py`` script hygiene. (:pull:`4948`, :pull:`4949`, :pull:`4950`)

#. `@pp-mo`_ split the module :mod:`iris.fileformats.netcdf` into separate
   :mod:`~iris.fileformats.netcdf.loader` and :mod:`~iris.fileformats.netcdf.saver`
   submodules, just to make the code easier to handle.

#. `@trexfeathers`_ adapted the benchmark for importing :mod:`iris.palette` to
   cope with new colormap behaviour in Matplotlib `v3.6`. (:pull:`4998`)

#. `@rcomer`_ removed a now redundant workaround for an old matplotlib bug,
   highlighted by :issue:`4090`.  (:pull:`4999`)

#. `@rcomer`_ added the ``show`` option to the documentation Makefiles, as a
   convenient way for contributors to view their built documentation.
   (:pull:`5000`)

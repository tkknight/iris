Iris' Mesh Partner Packages
****************************
Python is an easy to use language and has formed a very strong collaborative
scientific community, which is why Iris is written in Python. *Performant*
Python relies on calls down to low level languages like C, which is ideal for
structured grid work since
they can be directly represented as NumPy arrays. This is more difficult when
working with unstructured meshes where extra steps are needed to determine data
position (:ref:`see the data model detail <ugrid implications>`), and we need
to find ways of again passing the operations down to more optimised languages.

The Iris team are therefore developing 'wrapper' packages, which make it quick
and easy to analyse Iris mesh data via some popular Python packages that use
powerful tools under the hood, working in C and other languages.

These solutions have been placed in their own 'partner packages' for several
reasons:

* Can be useful to others who are not using Iris.

  * Everyone working with multi-dimensional geographic datasets shares common
    problems that need solving.
  * Wider user base = stronger community = better solutions.

* Only some Iris users will need them - they are **optional** Iris dependencies.

  * They introduce a lot of new API.
  * They introduce new large dependencies that take time to install and need
    disk space.

Below you can learn more about the partner packages and how they are useful.
Specifics of what operations would require their installation can be found in:
:doc:`operations`.

.. important:: **Experimental**

        As with Iris' mesh support, these packages are still in the
        experimental stages. They would love your feedback, but as immature
        packages their API, documentation, test coverage and CI are still
        'under construction'.

.. rubric:: "Cartographic rendering and mesh analytics powered by `PyVista`_"

PyVista is described as "VTK for humans" - VTK is a very powerful toolkit for
working with meshes, and PyVista brings that power into the Python ecosystem.
GeoVista in turn makes it easy to use PyVista specifically for cartographic
work, designed from the start with the Iris
:class:`~iris.experimental.ugrid.Mesh` in mind.

Applications
------------
* Interactively plot mesh data:

  * On a 3D globe.
  * On your favourite projection.

* Extract a specific region from a mesh.
* Combine multiple meshes into one.

.. rubric:: "A collection of structured and unstructured ESMF regridding schemes for Iris"

ESMF provide a sophisticated, performant regridding utility that supports a
variety of regridding types with both structured grids and unstructured meshes,
and this also has a flexible Python interface - ESMPy. iris-esmf-regrid takes
advantage of having a specific use-case - regridding Iris
:class:`~iris.cube.Cube`\s - to provide ESMPy-Iris wrappers that make the
process as easy as possible, with highly optimised performance.

Applications
------------
* Regrid structured to unstructured.
* Regrid unstructured to structured.
* Regrid with dask integration, computing in parallel and maintaining data
  laziness.
* | Save a prepared regridder for re-use in subsequent runs.
  | Regridders can even be re-used on sources with different masks - a
    significant efficiency gain.

Mesh Support
************

Iris includes specialised handling of mesh-located data (as opposed to
grid-located data). Iris and its :ref:`partner packages <ugrid partners>` are
designed to make working with mesh-located data as simple as possible, with new
capabilities being added all the time. More detail is in this section and in
the :mod:`iris.experimental.ugrid` API documentation.

This mesh support is based on the `CF-UGRID Conventions`__; UGRID-conformant
meshes + data can be loaded from a file into Iris' data model, and meshes +
data represented in Iris' data model can be saved as a UGRID-conformant file.

Meshes are different
  Mesh-located data is fundamentally different to grid-located data.
  Many of Iris' existing operations need adapting before they can work with
  mesh-located data, and in some cases entirely new concepts are needed.
  **Read the detail in these pages before jumping into your own code.**
Iris' mesh support is experimental
  This is a rapidly evolving part of the codebase at time of writing
  (``Jan 2022``), as we continually expand the operations that work with mesh
  data. **Be prepared for breaking changes even in minor releases.**
:ref:`Get involved! <development_where_to_start>`
  We know meshes are an exciting new area for much of Earth science, so we hope
  there are a lot of you with new files/ideas/wishlists, and we'd love to hear
  more ðŸ™‚.
